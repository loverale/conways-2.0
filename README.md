## Conways Game of Life 2.0
### (New Rules)

- For a populated cell to survive, it must have exactly two or three **or four** neighbors.
- Each cell that is populated, but only has one neighbor dies, as if by solitude.
- ~~Each cell that is populated and has four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.~~ -> No death by overpopulation.
- Each empty cell with three populated neighbors becomes populated.
