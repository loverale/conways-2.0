## Conways Game of Life
### But New Rules

For a populated cell to survive, it must have exactly two or three **or four** neighbors.
Each cell that is populated, but only has one neighbor dies, as if by solitude.
~~Each cell that is populated and has four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.~~ -> No death by overpopulation
Each empty cell with three populated neighbors becomes populated.
